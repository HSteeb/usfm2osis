\v 35 As Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he asked the question, “How can the teachers of the Law say that the Messiah will be the descendant of David?
\v 36 The Holy Spirit inspired David to say:
\q1 ‘The Lord said to my Lord:
\q2 Sit here at my right side
\q2 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing feet.’
\b

\v 37 David himself called him ‘Lord’; so how can the Messiah be David's descendant?”
